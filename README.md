# This is the Python Power Meter Program


v1.0 - Works with a nice gui and gives good results. For the next version add better excel with perhaps prices worked out. This version only works with csv files, in the future see what can be done with excel

v2.1 - This is where we added the field to make the tariffs available, they are not yet linked to anything however

v2.2 - This is where we were able to implement a button that is used to get the information of the field

v2.3 - This is the version where the fields now have the default set to 2.0 and the function that tests them works sort of. It adds the values for now. 

v2.4 - In this version, we created the excel spreadsheet in a rough format. FOr future versions:
-add a three extra tariffs in gui: Max demand, standard?, winter?
-add the full package to the excel output file
-add a loading bar when generating results

v2.5.1 Features added since v2.4:
-Gui moved around a bit and added fields for max demand, ECB and NEF levies.
-This is reflected in the excel output
